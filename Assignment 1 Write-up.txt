Assignment 1 Write-up questions.

1. I had to make sure to check that when I use the operator= function that I don't have a situation like A = A,
   so the function checks to see if the item on the left = the item on the right.

2. The copy constructor and the operator= functions both create copies of the function passes in,
   but the operator= function has to clear the variable first.

3. I checked to make sure that dynamic memory was properly allocated, and if it wasn't an exception was thrown or the 
   program was aborted. Also I made sure to delete all dynamic arrays when they are no longer needed.

4.The Big O of the array would be O(n). If the array is sorted it could cut the time to search the array in half.
  This would make the expression O(log n).
